STATUS: To my knowledge everything should be working. The genre search is not as intuitive as I'd like. Changing the drop genre drop down will add a genre to your genre search (or using the enter key or pressing the add genre button while drop down is on a genre). When searching multiple genres, the results will display all songs that have any of the genres (a better version of this would allow you to choose between AND OR when selecting multiple genres).


NOTES: Hopefully you won't think(too much)!
