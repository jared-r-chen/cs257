--END TO END FUNCTIONALITY--

The only thing that works right now is putting a search phrase into the song search bar and pressing the search button near the bottom of the block. This will return a table of results that include the index number, name of the song, artist name, ranking, and number of streams.

--FIRST DRAFT--

Working features:
- search database (by song name only)
- sort results
- flip order of results (greatest to least --> least to greatest or A-Z --> Z-A)
- songs like function (by song name only, genre doesn't work yet)
- help page is accessible 
-search by artist and/or artist and/or genre
-genre search in song-like function
